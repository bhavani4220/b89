        The problem of delays in the construction industry is a global phenomenon and the construction industry in Malaysia is no exception. The main purpose of this study is to identify the delay factors and their impact (effect) on project completion. Earlier studies either considered the causes or the effects of project delays, separately. This study takes an integrated approach and attempts to analyze the impact of specific causes on specific effects. A questionnaire survey was conducted to solicit the causes and effects of delay from clients, consultants, and contractors. About 150 respondents participated in the survey. This study identified 10 most important causes of delay from a list of 28 different causes and 6 different effects of delay. Ten most important causes were: (1) contractor’s improper planning, (2) contractor’s poor site management, (3) inadequate contractor experience, (4) inadequate client’s finance and payments for completed work, (5) problems with subcontractors, (6) shortage in material, (7) labor supply, (8) equipment availability and failure, (9) lack of communication between parties, and (10) mistakes during the construction stage. Six main effects of delay were: (1) time overrun, (2) cost overrun, (3) disputes, (4) arbitration, (5) litigation, and (6) total abandonment. This study has also established an empirical relationship between each cause and effect.

        <p >THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS divided into two sectors: Non-residential, which has three sub-sectors (heavy industrial, institutional and commercial, engineering), and Residential.

            Each sector has its own merits with a varied and rewarding range of work projects. You might find yourself:
            
            constructing cutting-edge, eco-friendly homes
            constructing massive hydro-electric projects like the Niagara Tunnel Project
            building state-of-the-art entertainment complexes, like the Edmonton arena, Rogers Place
            building a super-bridge, like the Port Mann Bridge
